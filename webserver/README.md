# Webserver

## Installing

To install the webserver, make sure you have python3 and pip installed. Then execute:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Make sure you have some way of forcing the target to redirect `downloader.tradingpaints.com` to your machine, this is out of scope for YWDAC. 

Once that is accomplished, you can run:

```bash
python3 webserver.py
```
